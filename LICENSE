## DDUI Additional Terms
These Additional Terms clarify how Prosperity 3.0.0 applies to DDUI and make the open‑core intent explicit.

1. **Full features for non‑commercial users.** All features present in the public repository are available to non‑commercial users under Prosperity 3.0.0, without artificial gating.
2. **Commercial use.** “Commercial” includes use (i) by or on behalf of a for‑profit entity; (ii) to provide paid services/hosting to others; (iii) in exchange for money or equivalent consideration; or (iv) within any revenue‑generating product or platform. Commercial users must obtain a separate commercial license.
3. **Attribution.** Keep copyright notices and license references in source files and UI “about” dialogs where reasonably provided.
4. **Trademarks.** Project names, logos, and related marks are not licensed; don’t imply endorsement. You may describe factual compatibility.
5. **Contributions.** By submitting a contribution, you agree that (a) you have the right to do so, and (b) it is licensed under the same terms as the project (inbound=outbound), unless a different agreement is made in writing.
6. **No warranty.** The software is provided “as‑is,” without warranty of any kind. Liability is disclaimed and limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.
7. **Termination.** Rights automatically terminate if you violate the license; they may be reinstated upon prompt cure where applicable.
